# TASK-2: SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM

## Project Overview

This project, "TASK-2: SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM," is focused on building a foundational speech-to-text system. The goal is to create a functional system that can transcribe short audio clips into text. The implementation will leverage pre-trained models and established libraries for speech recognition, such as `SpeechRecognition` or `Wav2Vec`.

## 1. Introduction

Speech recognition is a rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence that focuses on converting spoken words into text. This technology has become ubiquitous, powering virtual assistants, dictation software, and accessibility tools. This project provides a hands-on opportunity to build a basic speech recognition system using modern, pre-trained models.

## 2. Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to create a simple, yet effective, system that can take an audio input and produce a textual output. This will demonstrate an understanding of the fundamental principles of speech-to-text conversion and the practical application of relevant Python libraries.

## 3. Instructions

The core instruction for this task is to **build a basic speech-to-text system using pre-trained models and libraries like `SpeechRecognition` or `Wav2Vec`**. This allows for a focus on the system's integration and functionality rather than training a model from scratch.

### Step-by-Step Guide:

1.  **Choose a Library:** Decide whether to use a high-level library like `SpeechRecognition` for ease of use or a more advanced, model-based approach with `Wav2Vec` (or a similar Hugging Face model) for deeper learning.
2.  **Set up the Environment:** Create a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies.
3.  **Handle Audio Input:** Develop a mechanism to accept short audio clips. This could be from a file (e.g., `.wav`, `.mp3`) or live microphone input.
4.  **Process the Audio:** Pre-process the audio clip to prepare it for the recognition model (e.g., converting to the correct sampling rate, format).
5.  **Perform Recognition:** Use the chosen library or model to transcribe the audio.
6.  **Display the Output:** Print the transcribed text to the console or save it to a file.
7.  **Error Handling:** Implement basic error handling for common issues like no speech detected, API errors, or file not found.
8.  **Create a Simple Interface:** A command-line interface is sufficient, but a basic GUI could be a good enhancement.

## 4. Deliverables

The final deliverable for this project is a **functional system capable of transcribing short audio clips**. This implies a working codebase that can be executed to perform the specified task.

## 5. Technologies and Libraries

* **Python 3.x:** The primary programming language.
* **SpeechRecognition:** A robust, high-level library that acts as a wrapper for various speech recognition APIs and engines (e.g., Google Web Speech API, Sphinx, Wit.ai).
* **PyAudio:** A library required by `SpeechRecognition` for microphone input.
* **Wav2Vec:** An advanced, self-supervised pre-trained model for speech recognition from Facebook AI, often accessed via the `Hugging Face Transformers` library.
* **pydub:** A simple library for audio manipulation, useful for handling different audio file formats.
* **scipy:** For scientific computing and signal processing, potentially useful for manual audio analysis.
* **Virtualenv:** For creating an isolated Python environment.

## 6. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.6 or higher.
* `pip` (Python package installer).
* For `PyAudio` on some systems, you may need to install system-level dependencies.
    * **macOS:** `brew install portaudio`
    * **Ubuntu/Debian:** `sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio`
    * **Windows:** `pip install pyaudio` (Note: some users may need to find a pre-compiled wheel).

## 7. Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/speech-recognition-task.git](https://github.com/your-username/speech-recognition-task.git)
    cd speech-recognition-task
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    * **macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    * **Windows:**
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

4.  **Install Required Libraries:**
    * **Using `SpeechRecognition`:**
        ```bash
        pip install SpeechRecognition pyaudio
        ```
    * **Using `Wav2Vec` (and Hugging Face):**
        ```bash
        pip install transformers torch torchaudio
        ```
        *Note: `torch` can be large. Consider the appropriate version for your system (e.g., with or without CUDA support).*

## 8. Usage

### Command-line Interface

To run the system, you will use a simple command.

* **From a file:**
    ```bash
    python main.py --file "path/to/your/audio.wav"
    ```
    *Supported formats may include `.wav`, `.flac`, etc., depending on the chosen library.*

* **From a microphone:**
    ```bash
    python main.py --mic
    ```
    *The system will listen for a short period and then transcribe what it heard.*

* **With different models (if implemented):**
    ```bash
    python main.py --file "audio.wav" --model "google"
    python main.py --file "audio.wav" --model "wav2vec"
    ```

## 9. Code Structure

The project's code should be organized for clarity and maintainability. A potential structure might look like this:
